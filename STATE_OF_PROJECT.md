# State of the Project: TITANIC OS (GMAO / PDR Engine)
**Date:** April 19, 2026
**Target Audience:** Engineering & Security Teams

This document provides a comprehensive technical analysis of TITANIC OS as of April 19, 2026. It reflects the recent UI/UX unification to the "Titan" aesthetic, the completion of the Preventive Maintenance (PM) module, and the implementation of a centralized Permission/RBAC system.

## 1. Tech Stack & Environmental Matrix

*   **Core UI:** React 18/19 with TypeScript, bundled via Vite.
*   **State Management:** 
    *   **Zustand:** Powering the OS-like window management (`useTabStore`) and Portal navigation (`useOsStore`).
    *   **Dexie.js:** Version 10 schema. Local-first, high-performance IndexedDB wrapper with reactive queries (`useLiveQuery`).
*   **Visual Engine:** Tailwind CSS v4 with the **"Titan" Design System**.
    *   Industrial dark theme with neon accentuation (Cyan, Emerald, Rose, Amber).
    *   Custom utility classes for physical UI components (`.titan-card`, `.titan-input`, `.titan-label`).
*   **Motion Matrix:** `motion/react` for system-level transitions and interactive animations.

## 3. Data Integrity & Security (Audit Shield)

The application implements a strict **Zero-Trust** approach for administrative actions.

### Audit Trail Matrix
Every destructive or configuration-level event is logged in the `auditLogs` table via the `useAuditTrail` hook.
*   **Attributes Captured:** User ID, Name, Action Type, Entity ID, Severity (INFO/WARNING/CRITICAL), and Payload Details.
*   **Encapsulation:** All PM and System actions (e.g., purging DB, updating RBAC, creating schedules) trigger an audit pulse.

### Permission Guard (RBAC)
A centralized guard system (`permissions.ts`) controls access based on roles:
*   **Founders:** Absolute DNA clearance. Undeleatable and possess global override.
*   **Admins/Managers:** Authorized for System Config and high-level management.
*   **Technicians/Engineers:** Operational clearance only (PDR & Preventive).
*   **Enforcement:** Real-time gatekeeping in `DesktopLayout` and `LaunchpadView`.

## 4. Feature Portals: Current Progress

### ✅ PDR Engine (Operational)
*   **Hiearachy:** Family -> Template -> Blueprint. Absolute SKU collision prevention.
*   **Inventory:** Multi-warehouse stock tracking with movement auditing.

### ✅ Shield Ops / Preventive Maintenance (FOCUSED)
*   **Checklists:** Recursive task lists with criticality flags.
*   **Tactical Schedules:** Machine-based frequency engine with auto-due calculations.
*   **Deployment Queue:** Real-time Work Order terminal for technicians.
*   **Excel Sync:** Hub for importing/exporting PM master data with backup integrity.

### ✅ System Configuration (Titan Polish)
*   **RBAC Node:** Detailed user management with portal-specific toggles.
*   **Neural Core Backup:** High-speed serialization for DB snapshots (Export/Import).
*   **Policy Matrix:** Configuration for session timeouts and developer debug layers.

## 5. Visual Identity: The "Titan" Aesthetic

The UI has been unified under the **Titan Design System**:
*   **Color Palette:** Carbon Black (`#050508`) surfaces with high-visibility neon accents.
*   **Typography:** Italicized, heavy tracking-tighter headers for an aggressive industrial feel.
*   **Card Design:** `.titan-card` utilizes subtle inner glows and sharp border definition instead of soft shadows.
*   **Interactivity:** Hover-states trigger scale pulses and accent-color glows, providing positive tactile feedback.

## 6. Next Engineering Steps
1.  **Stock-PM Synchronization:** Wire PM Work Orders to consume stock items from the Inventory automatically upon completion.
2.  **Machine Telemetry:** Integration of IoT/Sensor data into the Preventive Dashboard for predictive alerts.
3.  **Global Search Logic:** A "Spotlight" search to jump between Blueprints, Technicians, and Work Orders across the entire OS.
